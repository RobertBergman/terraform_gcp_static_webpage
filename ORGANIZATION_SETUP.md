## Current Status

- Organization: None found
- Project: web-page-8ce1f44f (no organization)

## Options to Create an Organization

### Option 1: Google Cloud Identity Free (Recommended for Personal Use)
This is FREE and perfect for individual developers.

1. **Visit**: https://cloud.google.com/identity/docs/set-up-cloud-identity-free
2. **Sign up** with a domain you own (e.g., fatesblind.com)
3. **Verify domain ownership**
4. **Create Cloud Identity Free account**

**Steps:**
```bash
# After creating Cloud Identity, find your organization ID:
gcloud organizations list

# You'll see something like:
# DISPLAY_NAME      ID                DIRECTORY_CUSTOMER_ID
# fatesblind.com    123456789012      C01abcdef
```

### Option 2: Use Google Workspace
If you already have Google Workspace (formerly G Suite) for your domain.

### Option 3: Create Organization with Existing Domain
If you own a domain and want to use it:

1. Go to: https://workspace.google.com/gcpidentity/signup
2. Enter your domain (fatesblind.com)
3. Verify you own the domain
4. Complete setup

## After Organization Creation

Once you have an organization, update your Terraform:

1. Get your organization ID:
```bash
gcloud organizations list
```

2. Update terraform.tfvars:
```hcl
billing_account = "01D7B7-328031-6B8063"
organization_id = "YOUR_ORG_ID_HERE"  # e.g., "123456789012"
folder_id = ""
```

3. Migrate existing project to organization (optional):
```bash
gcloud projects move web-page-8ce1f44f \
  --organization=YOUR_ORG_ID
```

## Benefits of Having an Organization

1. **OAuth2 Management**: Can create OAuth clients via Terraform
2. **IAM Policies**: Centralized identity management
3. **Resource Hierarchy**: Better project organization
4. **Security**: Organization-level security policies
5. **Billing**: Consolidated billing management

## Quick Setup with fatesblind.com

Since you already own fatesblind.com, you can:

1. Visit: https://workspace.google.com/gcpidentity/signup
2. Use "fatesblind.com" as your domain
3. Choose "Just you" for team size
4. Verify domain (you'll add a TXT record to your DNS)
5. Complete Cloud Identity Free setup

This will create an organization linked to fatesblind.com, making it perfect for your project!

## Verification Steps

After setup, verify with:
```bash
# Check organization
gcloud organizations list

# Check if project can be moved
gcloud projects describe web-page-8ce1f44f

# Move project to organization
gcloud projects move web-page-8ce1f44f --organization=ORG_ID
```
